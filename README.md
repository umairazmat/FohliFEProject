## 🗂️ Git Workflow

We follow a clean and professional Git branching strategy:

- `master` → Stable, production-ready code
- `dev` → Active development
- `feature/*` → Task-specific branches (e.g., `feature/user-table`)

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/user-table
# work & commit
git push origin feature/user-table
# open PR into dev
```
